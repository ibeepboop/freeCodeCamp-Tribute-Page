#freeCodeCamp Tribute Page -- A Tribute to Kevin's Chili by Michelle Meyer (@ibeepboop)

###This is my Tribute Page for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certificate.

The Office is one of my favorite TV shows of all-time, and the "Casual Friday" episode of the show, where Kevin brings in his famous chili, is one of my favorite episodes.

After what happens to the poor guy (and said chili) in the first few minutes of the show, *someone* needs to give him a tribute. I am honored to be the one to do it.
